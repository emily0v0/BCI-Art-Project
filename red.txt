Experience the intensity of anger by letting your heart race, face warm, and distress grow within. Recall a moment of uncontrollable anger or imagine a scenario that triggers your fury. Feel fear as your anxiety rises, breathing tightens, and an emptiness settles in your stomach. Imagine a real threat: your house on fire, boat sinking, or facing an earthquake. Or envision a daunting emotional challenge like a public speech or operation. Allow the anger and fear to grip you for a brief moment.
